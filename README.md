# Amazon-Review-Scraper
Using requests, I have made a web scraper that, given a link of an Amazon product, reads all the reviews with the details of the author, title, content and stars.
The code is super efficient and fast, it scans 5000 reviews in about 1 minute, all the reviews are saved in a Data Frame and transformed to a google docs document.
