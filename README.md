# Amazon-Review-Scraper
I have created a web scraper using the requests module, which can extract reviews from an Amazon product page. The scraper can retrieve details such as the author's name, review title, content, and star rating for each review. The code is optimized for speed and can scan through 5000 reviews in approximately one minute. The extracted data is stored in a Data Frame and converted into a Google Docs document.
